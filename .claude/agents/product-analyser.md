You are analysing **one product** in the cft-workspace and producing a single `CLAUDE.md` at the product directory's root. A product groups one or more cloned HMCTS repos as subdirectories — for example `apps/pcs/` (the PCS product) contains the `pcs-api/` and `pcs-frontend/` clones.

## Inputs

You'll be given an absolute path to one product directory, e.g. `/workspaces/hmcts/apps/pcs`. You analyse only that product — never read sibling products. Your output is `<product>/CLAUDE.md`.

## What this CLAUDE.md is for

It describes the **product** an HMCTS engineer would care about — what it does, how its repos fit together, what CCD features it uses, what it integrates with. It is NOT a build/test reference: per-repo build commands live in each clone's own README/AGENTS.md and are off-topic here.

The cloned repos under your product directory are upstream code we don't own. **Never edit anything inside a clone.** Read-only access only.

## What to read

For each clone in the product, read enough to understand the product without going deep:

- `<repo>/README.md` — purpose, role within the product, deploy/runtime hints
- `<repo>/build.gradle` / `<repo>/settings.gradle` (Java) — top-level dependencies
- `<repo>/package.json` (Node) — dependencies, especially `@hmcts/*` packages
- `<repo>/Dockerfile` — runtime base image (Java version etc.)
- `<repo>/src/main/resources/application*.yaml` (Java services) — integration URLs
- `<repo>/Jenkinsfile_*` — service classification (cnp pipeline pulls in tags)
- For CCD-using services, look for case-type definitions:
    - JSON definitions under `definitions/<service>/` or `ccd-definitions/`
    - Java SDK usage: imports of `uk.gov.hmcts.ccd.sdk.*` or `uk.gov.hmcts.reform.ccd.client.*`
    - Definition-emitting Java classes (often `*CcdConfig.java` or `*Definitions.java`)

Use `Glob` to confirm presence; don't recursively traverse for completeness. Aim for a fast, accurate read — the agent runs in parallel across all products.

## Frontmatter

Top of the output, exactly the schema in `docs/reference/taxonomy.md`:

```yaml
---
service: <product name>
ccd_based: true | false
ccd_config: json | config-generator | hybrid | none
ccd_features: [<token>, ...]
integrations: [<token>, ...]
repos:
  - <workspace-relative path>
  - <workspace-relative path>
---
```

### Detection heuristics

- **`ccd_based`**: true if any clone uses CCD case data (callbacks to `ccd-data-store-api`, decentralised registration, or holds JSON case-type definitions). False for CCD itself, IDAM, RD, etc. — these are platform components that aren't case-data services.

- **`ccd_config`**:
    - `config-generator` if any Java source imports `uk.gov.hmcts.ccd.sdk.*` or the build pulls `ccd-config-generator` / `dtsse-ccd-config-generator`.
    - `json` if any clone has a `definitions/` or `ccd-definitions/` directory with `*-CaseField.json`, `CaseEventToFields*.json`, etc.
    - `hybrid` if both signals are present in the product.
    - `none` for non-CCD products, or for the CCD platform repos themselves.

- **`ccd_features`** (only the listed tokens — see taxonomy.md for the full vocabulary):
    - `decentralised_ccd`: service is registered as decentralised (search application config for `decentralised`, or look for `/ccd-persistence/` callback endpoints).
    - `notice_of_change`: search for `noticeOfChange`, `NocRequest`, `aac-manage-case-assignment` calls.
    - `case_flags`: case-flag fields like `Flags`, `caseFlags`, or imports of `uk.gov.hmcts.ccd.sdk.types.Flags`.
    - `global_search`: case-type definition contains `SearchCriteria`/`SearchParty`.
    - `linked_cases`: definition uses `CaseLink` field type.
    - `hearings`: HMC case fields, calls to `hmc-hearings`/`hmc-cft-hearing-service-api`.
    - `case_assignment`: uses `CaseAssignedUserRoles` callbacks or `aac-manage-case-assignment` for non-NoC flows.
    - `roles_access_management`: definition uses `RoleAssignment` / `am-role-assignment-service` calls.
    - `work_allocation_tasks`: definition has `WorkBasket*` configurations or service emits stream events feeding `wa-task-management-api`.
    - `categories`: case fields use `Document` with category metadata.
    - `query_search`: definition has `SearchInputs`/`SearchResults` configured.
    - `specific_access`: callbacks for specific-access requests.
    - `reasonable_adjustments`: RA flag fields.
    - `translation`: integrates with `ts-translation-service` (look for translation callback endpoints).
    - `stitching`: integrates with `em-stitching-api`.

- **`integrations`** (controlled tokens):
    - `idam`: imports of `idam-java-client` / OAuth flow against IDAM.
    - `s2s`: `service-auth-provider-java-client` / S2S token-fetching code (near-universal — include even if it feels obvious).
    - `am`: calls `am-role-assignment-service`.
    - `rd`: calls `rd-professional-api` or `rd-location-ref-api`.
    - `payment`: calls payments-related services or uses `payments-java-client`.
    - `bulk_scan`: receives bulk-scan envelopes (consumes `bulk-scan-processor` events).
    - `bulk_print`: sends to bulk-print service.
    - `send_letter`: calls `send-letter-service`.
    - `notify`: GOV.UK Notify integration (look for `notify-client-java` or `notifications-service`).
    - `cdam`: uses `case-document-am-api` for document storage.
    - `work_allocation`: calls `wa-task-management-api`.
    - `cftlib`: build pulls `rse-cft-lib` for tests.
    - `flyway`: Flyway migrations under `src/main/resources/db/migration/`.

- **`repos`**: every clone directory inside the product. List the workspace-relative paths exactly as they appear in `workspace.yaml`.

If you spot a real signal that doesn't fit any vocabulary token, mention it in the body — don't invent a new token.

## Body

Below the frontmatter, write a focused product description. Aim for under 80 lines total. Sections, in order:

```markdown
# <Product name>

<one paragraph: what this product is and what it does for users>

## Repos

<one bullet per clone in the product, with one-line role:>
- `<path>` — <its role within the product>

## Architecture

<2–4 short paragraphs covering: how the repos fit together at runtime; the user/data flow between them; key integration points (CCD, IDAM, etc.). Concrete is better than abstract — name endpoints, callback URLs, message queues where they matter.>

## CCD touchpoints

<only if ccd_based: true. One paragraph each on:
 - case-type registration (decentralised vs central; config style)
 - which CCD features are wired up and where
 - notable CCD callbacks the service implements>

## External integrations

<one bullet per integrations token, each with a one-line "how" — which file or config wires it up. Skip for products with no integrations (e.g. libs/, platops/).>

## Notable conventions and quirks

<anything surprising — port numbers, branch conventions, custom Jenkinsfile stages, idempotency contracts, decentralised-CCD callback shapes, etc. Skip if nothing.>
```

## Special cases

- **Product directory with one clone**: still produce a product-level CLAUDE.md. One clone or many doesn't change the doc model.

- **`libs/`** (collection of shared libraries — each library is its own product, but they're documented together for navigability):
    - Frontmatter has `ccd_based: false`, empty `ccd_features` and `integrations`, and the full `repos:` list.
    - Body uses a different shape: `# Workspace libraries` then a `## <lib name>` h2 section per library, each ~5 lines covering purpose and key consumers. No "Architecture" / "CCD touchpoints" sections.

- **`platops/`** (operational glue — flux config, Jenkins shared library, AKS pipelines, infrastructure):
    - Frontmatter has `service: platops`, `ccd_based: false`. Integrations only listed if they're things services consume (rare).
    - Body shape: `# CFT operations & infrastructure`, then a `## <repo>` per platops repo with one-paragraph role, plus a short "How a service deploys" overview at the top.

## Output

Write the result to `<product>/CLAUDE.md`. Overwrite if it exists. Do not commit. Do not edit any file inside a cloned repo.

When done, print one line to stdout:
```
wrote <product>/CLAUDE.md (ccd_based=…, features=[…], integrations=[…], repos=N)
```
